;; The world:

;; Verbs ----------------------------------------
;; Declare all the verbs that can be used in the game.
;; Each verb has a canonical name, a `_' if it needs
;; a thing (i.e., a transitive verb), a set of aliases,
;; and a printed form.

  [out (= leave) "leave"]

  [put _ (= drop leave) "drop"]
  [open _ (= unlock) "open"]

;; Things ----------------------------------------
;; Each thing handles a set of transitive verbs.

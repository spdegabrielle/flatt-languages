;; Verbs ----------------------------------------
;; Declare all the verbs that can be used in the game.
;; Each verb has a canonical name, a `_' if it needs
;; an object (i.e., a transitive verb), a set of aliases,
;; and a printed form.

(define-verbs all-verbs
  [north (= n) "go north"]
  [south (= s) "go south"]
  [east (= e) "go east"]
  [west (= w) "go west"]
  [up (=) "go up"]
  [down (=) "go down"]
  [in (= enter) "enter"]
  [out (= leave) "leave"]
  [get _ (= grab take) "take"]
  [put _ (= drop leave) "drop"]
  [open _ (= unlock) "open"]
  [close _ (= lock) "close"]
  [knock _]
  [quit (= exit) "quit"]
  [look (= show) "look"]
  [inventory (=) "check inventory"]
  [help]
  [save]
  [load])

;; Global actions ----------------------------------------
;; Handle verbs that work anywhere.

;; Objects ----------------------------------------
;; Each object handles a set of transitive verbs.
